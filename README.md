## Note:
The project is designed and built for master thesis purposes. Hence, this GUI is not a full-scale interface for windpowerlib python.
Most of the capabilities of this tool are built to address the master thesis requirements and further solve OEMOF models. 
While the windpowerlib python can do much more. read documentation [https://windpowerlib.readthedocs.io/]
